start with npm init
npm is a library jaha sare packages milte hai 
npm i express
package .json =package and their version 
package lock.json =detailed list of all dependancy 
all team members need to work on same version
using nodemon -khud restart kr deta
different ways of writing functionsss
callback function =ek main kaam krne k baad just baad dusra kaam krna 
main funciton me callback as a parameter pass krna pdega 
node js me bhot sare packages hote hai toh we can use those  
jese for example :fs(file) aur os(operaring system)
iske functions google kr sakte hai whenevr needed
fs.append(path,data,callback)
 export krne k liye require krna pdega aur jis file se import krre waha s export wali line likhni pdegi 
 lodash ek lib hai jo bhot sari functionality deta hai to deal with data==> var _ =require('lodash');
 server kese banate hai ===thriugh node js
 what is server ----someone that communicates with client ..provides all information  that client need 
 server is like waiter 
 server is mediator betwen database and client
 json data ko acche se arrange krta hai taaki user acche se samjh sakte--exp: waiter ache se khana arrang ekrkr deta hi \
 json is light weight "string" so easy to transport from one place to other
 object and json are easy to convert in each other 
 client -->internet---->server ---->database
 api and end point 
 -waiter wahi samjhta hai jo menu me defined hai 
 - these items in menu card -instruction are called end points
 - and a collection of these is called api
 we use express to create server
serevr -waiter ka kuch ghar hoga 
computer me uske ghar hai localhost that is our own computer
differnet methids to talk to server -get-post-delete -patch
server interact  with database and give respose --- kuch cheeze server khud kr sakta aur jonhi kr sakta woh database se mang k deta hai 
database has its own server 
whenever node js server require data it iteract with databse server and is return the data to node js server
compass -to visualize data throught gui 
postman -request handle krega aur waha se durectlywe can se how we  will get and send data 
mongodb has a drvier jo node js and mongo db k beech m bridhe hota hai 
mongodb has its own driver but we use mongoose because it is more efficient 
it is object data modelling (odm)
mongoose se connection extablish kara 
models is blue print of database
model bana k server.js file me export kare
phir we use body parser to parse the data  - it process the daata 

body pareser json data ko javascript object me convert kr deta hai 
middle wear use krne k liye we ise app.use(middleware)
body parser stores data in req.body
ASYNC AND AWAIT ====async mtlb aise task jise complete hone me time lagta hai so jab tak khtm nhi h jata we have to wait for that isiliye sath me we use await to wit jab tak pura n ho jaatta jese data lana .we use try catch block 
creating post method for person 
defining menu k liye schema khud se and gwt and post method
writing parameterized api callback ==did it 
creating routes==very imp 
express router is used bhot aasan just use the same method in different file using router function 
update:::
we need to knoe kya change krna hai 
we use unique id given by mongodb 
delete method
